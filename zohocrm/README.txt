D7 port tasks
-------------

1. Remove CCK fields support / map CCK fields to core fields

"As far as porting to D7 is concerned, I'm expecting that most parts
of the module code will be quite straightforward to port expect one
essential part - that is CCK fields support. In D7 fields are moved
to core and whatever code I have in D6 to provide support for CCK
fields won't really be portable to D7. Did you look into that so
far? Any thoughts?"
